    "# Experimenting With Different Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a reliable way to measure model accuracy, you can experiment with alternative models and see which gives the best predictions.  But what alternatives do you have for models?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see in scikit-learn's [documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) that the decision tree model has many options (more than you'll want or need for a long time). The most important options determine the tree's depth.  Recall from [the first lesson in this course](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/how-models-work) that a tree's depth is a measure of how many splits it makes before coming to a prediction.  This is a relatively shallow tree\n",
    "\n",
    "![Depth 2 Tree](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/R3ywQsR.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, it's not uncommon for a tree to have 10 splits between the top level (all houses) and a leaf.  As the tree gets deeper, the dataset gets sliced up into leaves with fewer houses.  If a tree only had 1 split, it divides the data into 2 groups. If each group is split again, we would get 4 groups of houses.  Splitting each of those again would create 8 groups.  If we keep doubling the number of groups by adding more splits at each level, we'll have \\\\(2^{10}\\\\) groups of houses by the time we get to the 10th level. That's 1024 leaves.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we divide the houses amongst many leaves, we also have fewer houses in each leaf.  Leaves with very few houses will make predictions that are quite close to those homes' actual values, but they may make very unreliable predictions for new data (because each prediction is based on only a few houses).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a phenomenon called **overfitting**, where a model matches the training data almost perfectly, but does poorly in validation and other new data.  On the flip side, if we make our tree very shallow, it doesn't divide up the houses into very distinct groups.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At an extreme, if a tree divides houses into only 2 or 4, each group still has a wide variety of houses. Resulting predictions may be far off for most houses, even in the training data (and it will be bad in validation too for the same reason). When a model fails to capture important distinctions and patterns in the data, so it performs poorly even in training data, that is called **underfitting**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we care about accuracy on new data, which we estimate from our validation data, we want to find the sweet spot between underfitting and overfitting.  Visually, we want the low point of the (red) validation curve in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![underfitting_overfitting](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/AXSEOfI.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "There are a few alternatives for controlling the tree depth, and many allow for some routes through the tree to have greater depth than other routes.  But the *max_leaf_nodes* argument provides a very sensible way to control overfitting vs underfitting.  The more leaves we allow the model to make, the more we move from the underfitting area in the above graph to the overfitting area.\n",

    "现在您有了一种可靠的方法来衡量模型的准确性，您可以尝试替代模型并查看哪个模型的预测效果最好。但是对于模型你有什么选择呢？\n",
    "\n",
    "您可以在 scikit-learn 的 [文档](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) 中看到决策树模型有很多选项（比您想要的更多）或需要很长时间）。最重要的选项决定了树的深度。回想一下 [本课程的第一课](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/how-models-work)，树的深度衡量的是它在进行预测之前进行了多少次拆分。这是一棵相对较浅的树\n",
    "\n",
    "![深度 2 树](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/R3ywQsR.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "实际上，一棵树在顶层（所有房屋）和一片叶子之间有 10 个分裂的情况并不少见。随着树越来越深，数据集被分割成具有更少房屋的叶子。如果一棵树只有 1 个分裂，它会将数据分成 2 组。如果每组再拆分，我们将得到 4 组房屋。再次拆分每个将创建 8 个组。如果我们通过在每个级别添加更多拆分来继续使组数加倍，那么到第 10 级时我们将拥有 \\\\(2^{10}\\\\) 组房屋。那是 1024 片叶子。\n",
    "\n",
    "当我们在许多叶子中划分房屋时，每片叶子中的房屋也更少。房屋很少的叶子会做出非常接近这些房屋实际价值的预测，但它们可能会对新数据做出非常不可靠的预测（因为每个预测仅基于少数房屋）。\n",
    "\n",
    "这是一种称为**过度拟合**的现象，其中模型几乎完美匹配训练数据，但在验证和其他新数据方面表现不佳。另一方面，如果我们把树做得很浅，它就不会把房子分成非常不同的组。\n",
    "\n",
    "在极端情况下，如果一棵树只把房子分成 2 或 4 组，每组仍然有各种各样的房子。对于大多数房屋，即使在训练数据中，结果预测也可能相去甚远（出于同样的原因，在验证中也会很糟糕）。当一个模型未能捕获数据中的重要区别和模式时，即使在训练数据中它也表现不佳，这称为 **欠拟合**。\n",
    "\n",
    "由于我们关心根据验证数据估计的新数据的准确性，因此我们希望找到欠拟合和过拟合之间的最佳平衡点。在视觉上，我们想要下图中（红色）验证曲线的低点。\n",

    "＃ 例子\n",
    "有几种方法可以控制树的深度，其中许多方法允许通过树的某些路径比其他路径具有更大的深度。但是 *max_leaf_nodes* 参数提供了一种非常明智的方法来控制过度拟合与欠拟合。我们允许模型制作的叶子越多，我们从上图中的欠拟合区域移动到过拟合区域的次数就越多。\n",
