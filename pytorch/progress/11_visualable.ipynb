    "# 11 可视化\n",
    "## 11.1 使用Visdom在 PyTorch 中进行可视化\n",
    "Visdom是Facebook在2017年发布的一款针对PyTorch的可视化工具。官网,visdom由于其功能简单，一般会被定义为服务器端的matplot，也就是说我们可以直接使用python的控制台模式进行开发并在服务器上执行，将一些可视化的数据传送到Visdom服务上，通过Visdom服务进行可视化\n",
    "### 安装\n",
    "Visdom的安装很简单，直接使用命令\n",
    "```pip install visdom```\n",
    "安装即可。 在安装完成后，使用命令在本地启动服务器，启动后会提示It's Alive! You can navigate to http://localhost:8097 这就说明服务已经可用，我们打开浏览器，输入http://localhost:8097 即可看到页面。\n",
    "```python -m visdom.server ```\n",
    "\n",
    "端口8097是默认的端口可以在启动命令后加 -port参数指定端口，常用的参数还有 --hostname，-base_url等\n",
    "\n",
    "### 基本概念\n",
    "#### Environments\n",
    "Environments的作用是对可视化区域进行分区，每个用户都会有一个叫做main的默认分区，在程序指定的情况下，默认的图表都会放到这里面\n",
    "#### Panes\n",
    "Panes是作为每一个可视化图表的容器，可以使用生成的图表，图片，文本进行填充，我们可以对Panes进行拖放，删除，调整大小和销毁等操作：  Panes和Environments是一对多的关系，即一个Environments可以包含多个Panes\n",
    "#### VIEW\n",
    "在对Panes进行调整后，可以通过VIEW对状态进行管理： \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 可视化接口\n",
    "Visdom是由Plotly 提供的可视化支持，所以提供一下可视化的接口: - vis.scatter : 2D 或 3D 散点图 - vis.line : 线图 - vis.stem : 茎叶图 - vis.heatmap : 热力图 - vis.bar : 条形图 - vis.histogram: 直方图 - vis.boxplot : 箱型图 - vis.surf : 表面图 - vis.contour : 轮廓图 - vis.quiver : 绘出二维矢量场 - vis.image : 图片 - vis.text : 文本 - vis.mesh : 网格图 - vis.save : 序列化状态\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 使用\n",
    "绘制简单的图形\n",
    "这里我们使用官方的DEMO来做样例"
